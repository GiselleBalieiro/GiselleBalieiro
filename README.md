# Hello Word 
I'm Giselle Balieiro!

# About me 
- 🎓 I'm studying Software Engineering. I also take complementary courses like the ones on the Alura platform to expand my knowledge.
- 💼 Currently, I am working as an access controller at the company Visão. I don't work in the area yet, but I want to start as soon as possible.
- 🌱 I'm learning HTML, CSS and JavaSript, because I want to have a broad view in front-end and back-and so I can specialize in a single language.
- 📫 How to find me: <a href="mailto:gisellefbalieiro">E-mail</a>
